abstract: >-
  Data model capturing circularity and end-of-life information for products, including material composition at beginning of life with DMP references, design-for-circularity attributes, performance factors and scores, and end-of-life pathways such as disassembly, recycling, treatment options, and CRM recovery-related information. The model creates a circular loop by linking materials used at product beginning of life to materials recovered at end of life.
