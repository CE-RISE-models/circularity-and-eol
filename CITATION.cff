abstract: >-
  Data model capturing circularity and end-of-life information for products, including design-for-circularity attributes, performance factors and scores, and end-of-life pathways such as disassembly, recycling, treatment options, and CRM recovery-related information. The model provides an autonomous framework with generic assessment storage supporting multiple methodologies while maintaining interoperability potential.
